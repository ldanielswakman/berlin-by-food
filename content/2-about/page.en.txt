Berlin by Food is currently a one-woman show. The woman in question is me - Anne - a pescatarian Franco-American-British Berliner who studied German and Russian and likes to cook and eat. When not giving tours, I earn my living as a journalist, translator and coordinator for the Stolpersteine, a Holocaust commemoration project. I am, as you can tell, eclectic and that's why I’m your perfect guide. I will adapt to your wishes - and no culinary desire will be too wild .. I have lived in Berlin for going on 10 years now and have eaten my way around the city. I can advise on the best restaurants, the dodgiest Eckkneipe (a dying breed, so get your Berliner Pils while you still can), I can tell you where to find vegan chocolate ice-cream to die for, an avocado smoothie that will blow your socks off or a slice of pizza that will transport you to Italy. I can even advise you on where to check out Currywurst and kebabs, though I can't exactly vouch for their taste because I haven’t eaten a scrap of meat in quite a while… 

If your appetite is whetted, send me an email or give me a phone call... Tours are privately organised, tailor-made to suit your taste. 

You can take the tours in English, French or German. English is my language mais je parle aussi francais und für die, die Deutsch hören wollen (freilich mit Akzent), dann keine Sorge!
