Berlin by Food is currently a one-woman show. The woman in question is me - Anne - a pescatarian Franco-American-British Berliner who studied German and Russian and likes to eat. When not giving tours, I earn a living as a journalist, translator and international coordinator for the (link: http://www.stolpersteine.eu/ text: Stolpersteine) - Gunter Demnig's Holocaust commemoration project. 

I've lived in Berlin for going on 10 years now and have eaten my way around the city. I can advise on the best restaurants, the dodgiest Eckkneipe (a dying breed, so get your Molle while you still can) or simply where you can find vegan chocolate ice cream to die for.

The German capital is a fragmented city with a troubled past – that's what draws many of us – but it also has an ever-changing vibrant present and immigrants continue to arrive, fleeing war, conflict, political persecution and discrimination or economic misery.

Immigration is the best thing that can ever happen to a city’s food scene as any Londoner will tell you. These tours prove it for Berlin.

My (link: https://berlinbyfood.eu/tours/from-gastarbeit-to-gentrification/ text: From Gastarbeit to Gentrification) tour takes you to Kreuzkölln, the Berlin district which boasts the highest number of ethnic groups. You'll get to taste gözleme, baklava and much more, while learning more about the history of the city and about the life of German, Turkish, Syrian and French locals here.

There are those for whom a sweet tooth is not only an expression: If that's you, let's skip the savoury and go straight on to dessert – ice cream, pistachio baklava or the finest cheesecake this side of the Atlantic (and that is no exaggeration). 

Food is not the same without drink so we might also take you to a natural wine bar or to a Kiez wine shop to taste a Riesling, arguably the best white not only Germany, but the world, has to offer. If you just fancy a beer, no problem - this is Germany after all.
