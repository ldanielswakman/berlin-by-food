Text: Vegetarian was yesterday, now vegan is all the rage. On this tour, you can eat crepes, burgers and pizzas made without a trace of meat or dairy products. You'll also find out where to buy tofu sausages, spelt-almond milk, non-dairy cheese or quinoa, so you too can cook vegan at home (or in your airbnb).
