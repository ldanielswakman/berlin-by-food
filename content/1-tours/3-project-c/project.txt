Text: Berlin is one of the greenest capitals in the world and also one of the most innovative. On this tour, you might drink beer in a park conceived for hunting rabbits, drink cocktails in a former parking lot, picnic at an erstwhile airport, munch pizza or waffles by the canal or savour local salad leaves in a hidden garden. You'll see how Berliners do their best to make the most of every moment of sunshine sent by the gods.
