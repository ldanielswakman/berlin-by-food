**FOOD TOUR** / fuːd tʊə(r) / A guided walk in which you visit several places where you can taste different specialities to get an insight into a city’s foodscape

A tour lasts about two to three hours, give or take. Depending on the group dynamics and general atmosphere,  we can just play it by ear on the day. 

It costs between 35 and 50 euros a head.

NB: This is a walking tour and you need good shoes to cope with the distances and the cobblestones. I recommend that you have waterproofs and an umbrella on hand - Berlin is not typically a wet city but these days you never know. The "Open Spaces" tour only takes place when it is dry (there's a reason why I left the UK!).

You can take my meat-free tours in English, French or German. English is my language mais je parle aussi français und wenn Ihr Deutsch hören wollt (freilich mit Akzent), dann kein Problem!

Come relaxed and open-minded and hungry of course!
