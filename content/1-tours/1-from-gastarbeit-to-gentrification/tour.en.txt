Text: Gözleme, falafel, baklava and plenty more. This tour takes you to Kreuzkölln, the Berlin district which boasts the highest number of ethnic groups and is therefore ideal for introducing a variety of tastes, flavours and impressions. Meet the Turks, Arabs, Sudanese, Japanese and French immigrants, for example, who live here and have contributed to diversifying (or as some would say "improving") the city's foodscape.
