Text: 

Die Touren sind auf Englisch, Französisch oder Deutsch. English is my language, mais je parle aussi Français, und wenn Ihr Deutsch hören wollt (freilich mit Akzent), ist das auch kein Problem!

Denkt daran, dass die Berlin by food Tour ein Spaziergang ist und Berlin voller Kopfsteinpflaster – zieht Euch also am besten bequeme Schuhe an. Und auch wenn Berlin nicht so nass ist wie London, empfehle ich eine Regenjacke und einen Schirm – man weiß ja nie … Die „Im Freien“-Tour findet aber ohnehin nur bei schönem Wetter statt, denn nicht umsonst habe ich England verlassen.

Berlin by Food haftet nicht für gesundheitliche Probleme.
