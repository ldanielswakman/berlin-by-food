The German capital is a fragmented city with a troubled past –that's what draws many of us here – but it also has a vibrant present and immigrants continue to arrive. Immigration is the best thing that can ever happen to a city’s food scene. Londoners know full well that nobody would have coped with jellied eels and boiled carrots for much longer... New York would not be New York without bagels and pizza from Europe... Even Paris, which has nothing to blush about when it comes to food, has become an even better place to eat since Vietnamese, Chinese and Moroccan chefs arrived...
