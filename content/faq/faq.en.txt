You can take the tours in English, French or German. English is my language mais je parle aussi francais und wenn ihr Deutsch hören wollt (freilich mit Akzent), dann kein Problem! 

What is important is that you remember that this is a walking tour and you therefore need good shoes to cope with the distances and the cobblestones. I recommend that you have waterproofs and an umbrella on hand - Berlin is not typically a wet city but these days you never know. The "Open Spaces" tour only takes place when it is dry (there is a reason why I left the UK!).

Moreover, it’s a food tour, so come hungry!

Tours last about two hours, give or take. Depending on the dynamics of the group, they might be shorter or longer and we can just play it by ear on the day. Come relaxed and open-minded.

    up at the right time in the right place,
    and the rest is taken care of!
